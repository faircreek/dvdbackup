# dvdbackup

Please do not use this version of DVD backup. Use the one that is 
maintained by the Benjamin Drung/Stephen Gran at the Debian project.

Thought it just would be fun to actually have the original version
avalible to the public. Yet again a tool I wrote but then never
really needed to use, guess others did since it's been maintained.
